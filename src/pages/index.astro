			<h3>Hey, I'm Szymon</h3>
      <p>
        I'm an all-around tinkerer who enjoys diving into both software and mechanical engineering, and exploring the fascinating intersection between them. 
        I'm most familiar with web technologies (primarily React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Java). Currently teaching myself microcontroller programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not coding I fill my time with sports, mostly climbing üßó and volleyball üèê

				Currently working as Middle Full Stack Developer at Sollers Consulting

        I've graduated from Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology with Master's Degree in Management and Manufacturing Engineering
        and Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering
